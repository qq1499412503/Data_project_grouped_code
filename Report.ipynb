        "Ensemble learning have been widely used in the field of machine learning, plenty of successful classifier was created based on it. ensemble method refers to the structure which built by several individual classifier and integrate all decisions into a specific result. in this method, there are two different ensemble types which are homogeneous and heterogeneous. in homogeneous method the ensemble only include individual classifier in similar type such as decision tree ensemble only include individual classifier which is decision tree, the heterogeneous method is built by different types of classifier such as decision tree and neural network. this essay will explore several common topics under  the field of ensemble learning, it will focus on how to created diverse classifiers, how to fuse the decisions from individual classifiers and how to establish the weights that individual classifiers contribute to the ensembleâ€™s answer."
